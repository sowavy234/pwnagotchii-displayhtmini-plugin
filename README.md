this system will use object-oriented programming to encapsulate the LED and button functionality.

Now, let's break down the required libraries and their purposes:

RPi.GPIO: This is the main library for controlling Raspberry Pi's GPIO pins. It allows you to set up pins, read input, and control output.

Installation: sudo pip3 install RPi.GPIO

time: This is a built-in Python library used for adding delays in the script.

threading: This is a built-in Python library. While we're not using it extensively in this script, it's included for potential future expansion (e.g., if you want to add background tasks).

signal: This is a built-in Python library used to handle the Ctrl+C signal for graceful script termination.

sys: This is a built-in Python library used here for cleanly exiting the script.

To run this script:

Save it to a file, e.g., led_control_system.py.
Make sure you have the RPi.GPIO library installed.
Run the script with sudo python3 led_control_system.py.
This system provides the following improvements:

Object-oriented design for better organization and potential expansion.
Separate methods for turning the LED on and off.
Graceful shutdown handling with the signal module.
Clear separation of setup, main loop, and cleanup operations.
Remember to adjust the LED_PIN, BUTTON_A_PIN, and BUTTON_B_PIN variables according to your specific hardware setup.
